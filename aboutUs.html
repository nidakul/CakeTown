                    <p class="mb10">The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it
                        on
                        their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with
                        their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs.
